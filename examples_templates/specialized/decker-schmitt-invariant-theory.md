### Invariants of symmetric groups

The invariants of the symmetric groups $S_4$ and $S_3$ serve as basic examples, see Examples 2 and 7.

```julia
# INSERT_EXAMPLE specialized/decker-schmitt-invariant-theory/sym.jlcon
```

### The Heisenberg group of level 3

The Heisenberg group of level 3 in its Schr√∂dinger representation is studied in Examples 18, 21, and 23.

```julia
# INSERT_EXAMPLE specialized/decker-schmitt-invariant-theory/H3.jlcon
```

### Non-trivial module syzygies

This example of an invariant ring which is not Cohen--Macaulay is presented in Examples 19 and 26.

```julia
# INSERT_EXAMPLE specialized/decker-schmitt-invariant-theory/bertin.jlcon
```

### The Klein four-group

The invariants of the Klein four-group in a regular representation are computed in Examples 22, 24, and 25 both in characteristic 0 and characteristic 2.

```julia
# INSERT_EXAMPLE specialized/decker-schmitt-invariant-theory/klein.jlcon
```

### A complex reflection group

The fundamental invariants of a complex reflection group which is connected to an application in coding theory are discussed in Example 27.

```julia
# INSERT_EXAMPLE specialized/decker-schmitt-invariant-theory/gleason.jlcon
```

### A pseudo-reflection group in positive characteristic

An example of a pseudo-reflection group whose invariant ring is not a polynomial ring is presented in Example 28.

```julia
# INSERT_EXAMPLE specialized/decker-schmitt-invariant-theory/nakajima.jlcon
```

### Invariants of linearly reductive groups

Computations with invariants of linearly reductive groups can be found in Examples 34, 35, and 36.

```julia
# INSERT_EXAMPLE specialized/decker-schmitt-invariant-theory/LR-inv.jlcon
```

### The Cox ring of a linear quotient

This computation of a Cox ring of a linear quotient is worked out in Example 40.

```julia
# INSERT_EXAMPLE specialized/decker-schmitt-invariant-theory/cox_ring.jlcon
```
